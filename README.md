# Telemetry #
This component implements middleware for sensors and metrics aggregation.

## Capabilities ##
This application is implementation of Telemetry proposed in OpenBMC design docs
`[1]`.

It's responsible for:
- on-demand creation of metric reports,
  - aggregated sets of sensor values available in system `[2]`,
- access to metric report in both  pull and push model (triggers),
- run-time monitoring of sensor`[3]` updates.

## Use-cases ##
- generic and centralized way to observe telemetry data inside system
- back-end for Redfish TelemetryService`[4]`

## How to build ##
There are two way to build telemetry service:
- using bitbake in yocto environment
- using meson as native build

To build it using bitbake follow the guide from OpenBMC docs`[5]`.
To build it using meson follow the quick guide to install meson`[6]` and then
run below commands
```
meson build
cd build
ninja
```
After successful build you should be able to run telemetry binary or start unit
tests
```
./tests/telemetry-ut
./telemetry
```
In case if system is missing boost dependency, it is possible to build it
locally and set BOOST_ROOT environment variable to location of built files for
meson. After this change meson should be able to detect boost dependency. See
`[7]` for more details.

## Notes ##
More information can be found in OpenBMC docs repository `[8]`.
