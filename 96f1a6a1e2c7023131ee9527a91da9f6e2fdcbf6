      "message": "Reflecting on it more, i am not sure if it is design intent that PDI headers do not include each other.\n\n### Alternative 1 (i prefer this one)\n\n- PDI headers do not include each other\n- including one header might cause compilation failure if a dependent header is not also included\n- all interfaces which are used must be included \u003d\u003e code remains searchable\n\n### Alternative 2\n\n- This is a bug and the `ReportManager/common.hpp` must include the header it depends on\n- An interface can be used without explicitly including it -\u003e code is less searchable\n\n@patrick@stwcx.xyz what are your thoughts on it?\n\nFor now i removed these comments again since the PDI change for the namespace paths has been merged and we can include the `Telemetry.Report` header for the namespace path.",

I\u0027m surprised this didn\u0027t work but I\u0027m not sure off-hand why it is broken.\n\nAs far as the search-ability, I think that clang-tidy IWYU can take care of this.  If someone really is using the other header, then it should be included, but if it is just a transitive use then it wouldn\u0027t be included.",
