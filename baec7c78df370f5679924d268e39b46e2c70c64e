      "message": "\u003e What are the benefits of it? \n\nI\u0027ve outlined the benefits in the crosslinked patch in the commit message.  This handles more cases, and is in line with std::networking.\n\n\u003e You are just moving code from library to user code. You will have to add this if condition in every future usage of getProperty\n\nI\u0027m not following what you mean about moving to user code.  This whole file is user code unless I\u0027m mistaken, and I\u0027ve simply modified how error conditions are registered.\n\nThe difference between having to add a conditional versus having to construct a whole new lambda is negligible, and as you can see from this patch, seems to lead to less code, as the lambda captures aren\u0027t duplicated  between the two handlers.  This means that the complex objects aren\u0027t constructed twice, which should be good overall.  These benefits are called out in the commit message in sdbusplus.",

Thanks for explanation.\n\u003e \n\u003e There is one part that I disagree, current version (with separate callbacks) doesn\u0027t duplicate logic.\n\nFair point, I should\u0027ve said that it duplicates the captures, which isn\u0027t strictly \"logic\" so, you\u0027re right here.\n\n\u003e For some cases like this one, it is not important which error code was it, so once errorHandler is called no additional check is needed (I saw many cases like this in bmcweb).\n\nIt should be noted, this is an antipattern in bmcweb now.  As a general rule, there is info in the error message that generally results in status code changes to the response.  We\u0027re slowly going through and fixing them.\n\n\u003e Version with one callback will have to rapeat if (ec) in every invocation even for something trivial like this. I am not sure what you meant by less code (lines? characters? binary size?)\n\nAt least for the sdbusplus examples, the binary size is identical, because the optimizer seems to optimize the exact same.  In this case, I mean less characters;  If you look at the old code, there\u0027s repeated lambda captures.  That\u0027s the code that\u0027s \"duplicate\"\n\n\u003e but for sure in version with two callback common logic was already in getProperty and didn\u0027t have to be repeated in every invocation of getProperty.
