To be more precise, the method AddReport is called in 2 situations:\n- loadFromPersistent() is called - it will happen during construction of ReportManager, and is the reason why this if statement is in place\n- \u0027AddReport\u0027 is called on dbus, which will happen always after construction of ReportManager, at this point, pointer will be valid, and the if statement will always pass",
